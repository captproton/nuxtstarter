                    <p><strong>This policy was last modified on January 28, 2019.</strong></p>
            <p>The website you have entered (its sub-domains, affiliated websites, and any services available therefrom, including any mobile versions of the website or mobile applications) (the “Site”) is operated by Dice Media Group, LLC; and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates (Dice Media Group,” “we” or “us”). We respect your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting data collected from you and about you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, and protect that data.</p>
            <p><strong>If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using the Site immediately. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Collection of Data&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. We collect personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us.</strong></p>
            <p>We collect personal data from you in several different ways on the Site. Personal data means information that can reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, phone number, address, and email address). We collect this personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us (such as when you submit an inquiry or apply for a job online). You can choose not to provide the requested data, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain Site features.</p>
            <p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. We automatically collect data about your browser or device and your use of the Site.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>When you access and use the Site, our technology and tools may automatically collect and record certain data (which does not identify you as an individual) about your use of the Site (your IP address, browser type, the make and model of device used to view the Site, unique device identifiers, the referring web page, pages visited, search terms and other information relating to your use of the Site, browser or device).</p>
            <p>We also use various tracking technologies (such as cookies, clear GIFs, and/or pixel tags) to collect data about your use of and access to the Site. Cookies are small bits of information that may be placed on your computer by websites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are. Pixel tags generate a generic notice of a visit to the Site. Pixel tags are used in conjunction with cookies to anonymously track the activity on the Site by a particular browser on a particular site.</p>
            <p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Third-parties may also automatically collect data about you.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Some embedded content on the Site may be served by third-party content providers. Please note that these companies may also use cookies, pixels, tags or other similar technologies to collect data about you, both on the Site and throughout the Internet. Data collection and use by those third-parties is subject to the privacy policies of those third-parties.</p>
            <p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Our “Do Not Track” (DNT) Policy</strong></p>
            <p>Some websites have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. We do not currently respond to those signals or similar mechanism transmitted by web browsers. To learn more about browser tracking signals and DNT, please visit http://allaboutdnt.org.</p>
