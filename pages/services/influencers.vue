                  <h2>Approach</h2>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting inside VMâ€™s media department, our team builds and executes holistically-informed strategies where influencers produce and share branded assets, passing equity from their passionate, opt-in audiences to our clients.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Best-in-class proprietary &amp; partner technology assure that influencers reach the right audience</strong></p>
                  <p>Our influencer recommendations are justified through a proprietary tech stack. We analyze the audiences of our influencers, ensuring their audiences line up with your target as closely as possible.</p>
                  <p><strong>Platform-agnostic approach reaches the right consumer where they are most attentive</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We activate across many different platforms (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Musical.ly, etc.) depending upon who and how you want to communicate with your target.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Ability to activate micro-influencers at scale</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to working with those with larger followings, we have perfected a workflow for activating influencers with small yet passionate followings in mass. We routinely manage hundreds of influencers concurrently for our clients.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Obsession with evaluating the value of influencer context and distribution</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communication from influencers to their audiences is threaded with social context not evident in traditional media campaigns. We are committed to evaluating the value of these premium impressions relative to the rest of the media mix.</span></p>
