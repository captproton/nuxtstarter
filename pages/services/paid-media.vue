                  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our department is comprised of industry practitioners who pride themselves on understanding the full breadth and depth of media channels that drive business outcomes for brands. Media strategies often fail or succeed based on how well the channel-specific details have been planned out and accounted for, making these details something we care deeply about. The media division consists of several disciplines, including media planning, buying, and research, as well as reporting, analytics, and advertising technology. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Media Division also has the unique advantage of working alongside robust in-house creative and production teams. By having these disciplines all under one roof, we are able to tightly integrate creative and media considerations in all media planning efforts, ensuring buys are as impactful as possible.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Day-trading attention” is another core concept that drives our efforts. The team is constantly evaluating the full spectrum of platforms (both traditional and emerging) to determine where target audiences may be underpriced to reach. We are not romantic about any specific channels or tactics, and instead solely aim to capture the strongest media performance possible for advertisers based on the current marketing landscape. Intense curiosity and an ongoing “test and learn” approach drive this process, supplemented by internal, proprietary technology built to add additional, data-backed rigor.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, the team is unique in regard to its transparency and approach to tools. Exact details of all media purchased and the resulting data associated with those purchases are fully and openly shared with clients, including all rates paid, granular performance metrics, and anything else the clients may need.</span></p>
