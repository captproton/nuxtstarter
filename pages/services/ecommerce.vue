                    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our department offers full-service, à la carte discovery, strategy, and implementation offerings for Direct to Consumer (DTC) and Business-to-Business (B2B) advertisers.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not an above-the-line agency that doesn’t understand the blocking and tackling needed to launch a sustainable business, nor a consultancy that’s solely obsessed with the bottom line and detached from the realities of the modern consumer. Our dual sets of knowledge complement each other to create informed, long-game strategies that focus on generating revenue and providing value to our clients’ consumers.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>How we’re different:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Marketplace Optimization:<br>

                    </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A detailed plan that spells out the appropriate mix of media channels to meet a brand’s revenue goals as well as the media expertise to implement it.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Direct to Consumer Site Builds and Infrastructure Development:<br>
                    </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">From identifying the appropriate selling platform to ensuring backend logistics are structured to support the business, we will create a direct to consumer site that’s optimized for conversion and primed to collect valuable data.</span></p>
